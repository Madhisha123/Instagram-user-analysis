3. **Contest Winner Declaration**
   - Determined the contest winner and shared user details with the management team.

4. **Hashtag Research**
   - Identified and suggested the top 5 most commonly used hashtags on the platform.

5. **Ad Campaign Launch Analysis**
   - Determined which day of the week most users register on Instagram, helping to optimize ad campaigns.

6. **Investor Matrix**
   - Measured user engagement by:
     - Calculating the average number of posts per user.
     - Calculating the total number of photos divided by the total number of users.

7. **Bot and Fake Account Detection**
   - Detected users who have liked every single photo on the platform, which indicates abnormal or bot-like behavior.
